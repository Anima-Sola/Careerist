The game is a surreal, anti-science-fantasy businessman simulation with political ambitions. Victory in the game is to be elected president. To achieve your goal, you must earn money by buying businesses, playing the stock market, and having a little fun. There will be different troubles, illnesses, accidents and even death on the way to your desired goal. So be brave and go ahead.

At first glance the gameplay may seem complicated, but in fact it is not. Everything becomes simple as soon as you you learn how to avoid certain pitfalls. Intentionally, no hints are left to stretch the learning curve, but everything becomes clear as you play. Please do not treat the process with prejudice, it was not intended to make it close to reality. One should treat it, as entertainment.

It is based on a text game, written for the ZX-Spectrum platform, in the 80s or 90s. When exactly, history is silent. The game is written as close to the original as possible, but with correction of the errors, which significantly change the gameplay, made by the author, probably deliberately.
